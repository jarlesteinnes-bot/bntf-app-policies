            <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated: September 20, 2025</strong></p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Bristow Norge Teknisk Forening (BNTF) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use the BNTF mobile application ("the App").</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</strong></p>
            <p>The BNTF App is designed to operate entirely on your device without collecting or transmitting personal data. Specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No user accounts or registration required</li>
                <li>No personal information is requested or collected</li>
                <li>No usage data or analytics are collected</li>
                <li>No location data is accessed or stored</li>

                <li>No crash reports or diagnostic data are sent to us</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Local Data Processing</h2>
            <p>All app functionality occurs locally on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Calculation Tools:</strong> ACTT calculations, torque conversions, and weight conversions are performed locally on your device</li>
                <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Any settings or preferences are stored locally on your device using iOS standard UserDefaults</li>
                <li><strong>Temporary Data:</strong> Input values in calculators are temporarily stored in device memory only while the app is active</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. External Links</h2>
            <p>The App contains links to external websites and resources. These external sites have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of external websites.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since no personal data is collected or transmitted:</p>

                <li>There is no risk of personal data breaches from our app</li>
                <li>All calculations and data remain on your device</li>
                <li>Your privacy is protected by design</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Since we do not collect personal data, traditional data protection rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability) are not applicable. However, you can:</p>
            <ul>
